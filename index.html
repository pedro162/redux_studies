            Store:
                Redux.createStore().
                The store gives global access and allow despatch actions that modify the state.
                It's essential to pass a function as first argument parameter of crateStore, it function is called 'reducer'.
                The 'reducer' is a function responsible for returns the current store state

                function reducer(){
                    return{
                        name:'Pedro',
                        id:199,
                    }
                }

                const state = Redux.createStore(reducer)

            Reducer:
                The 'reducer' function receives two main arguments, the first one been the current state and the seconde one is an action 
                that will be utilized to identify the dispatched actions by the store

            Action:
                To update the state, we send an 'action' through the 'store' using the 'dispatch' method. An action is
                always an object witch contain the 'type' and a 'payload' value if necessary.

                Withing the 'reducer' we verify the type of the sended action and return the new state from it
        
            Action Creator
                Another common practice to facilitate the use of actions is the creation of functions that return the action's object
                function increase(){
                    return {type:INCREASE}
                }

                function sum(payload){
                    return {type:SUM, payload}
                }
            Subscribe:
                Represents a function that is executed every time a change happens in the state 
                const unsubscribeRender = store.subscribe(()=>{
                    //--Anything goes here
                })  

            Switch:
                It's common to use 'switch statement' within the 'reducer' instead of 'if/else'. It helps to facilitate readability and avoid
                repetition of 'action.type'

                function reducer(state={}, action){
                    switch(action.type){
                        case INCREASE:
                            return {...state, qtd:state?.qtd + 1}

                        case DECREASE:
                            return {...state, qtd:state?.qtd - 1}
                        default:
                            return state;
                    }
                }

            combineReducers:
                We can divide the 'reducer' code into different functions and combine them at the end.
                It's worth remembering that, in the end, the reducer will always be unique, and all dispatched actions will pass through all reducers
                
                Redux.combineReducers({reducer, reducer_modal})

            Pure Function:
                Pure functions always return the same value given the same argument and produce no side effects.
                Returning the same value means that the function internal calcs cannot depend on random numbers, time, date and others data that
                can change in the future

            Immutability:
                The 'reducer' function should always returns a new state, when it's get modified. Never change it directly (it should be immutable).
                
                const CHANGE_NAME = 'CHANGE_NAME';

                const initialState = {name:'pedro', age:29}
                const reducer = (state=initialState, action)=>{
                    let {type, payload} = action;
                    witch(type){
                        case CHANGE_NAME:
                            return {...state, name:payload}
                        default:
                            return state;
                    }
                }
            Immer:
                Immer is a package witch provides a function witch we can use all methods that change arrays and objects,
                without concern us with immutability. Because the immer responsibility will always be produce a new object/array
                cons obj01 = {name:'pedro', age:29}
                const obj02 = immer.producer(obj01, (draft)=>{
                    draft.age = 30;
                })

                console.log(obj01 == obj02)

                const reducer = immer.produce((state, action)=>{
                    let {type, payload} = action;
                    witch(type){
                        case CHANGE_NAME:
                            return {...state, name:payload}
                        default:
                            return state;
                    }
                }, initialState)

            Redux Toolkit:
                The Redux team identified that a lot of the code written to set up Redux is often repetitive.
                To address this, they created another package (which they recommend using) that simplifies common tasks,
                such as creating constants, action creators, configuring devtools, and integrating libraries like Immer and Redux-Thunk. 
                
                npm install @reduxjs/toolkit

                configureStore:
                    The configureStore automatically configure middlewares such as redux-thunk and devtools

                import {configureStore} from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
                const reducer = {

                }
                const store = configureStore({reducer:reducer})
        */

        import store from './store/configureStore.js'
        import {increase_action} from './store/counter.js'
        store.subscribe(()=>{
            console.log('It works')
        })

        store.dispatch(increase_action())
